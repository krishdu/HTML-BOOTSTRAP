				<p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (15 October 1931 ‚Äì 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974</p>
				<hr>
				<p>Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, <mark>including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</mark></p>

					<p class="mb-1">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from arab traders and local women. Their business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add to the family‚Äôs meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home.<br> In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics. After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline". He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.</p>

		   <h2 class="text-center"> Not just 'Missile Man': Here are five scientific contributions</h2>	
			<h4 class="mt-3">1. He was the Project Director in ISRO to help develop India's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle.</h4>
			<p>At a time when India had hardly dreamt of its own Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV), Dr. Kalam's efforts and hard work for over a decade, made it possible for us to develop our first indigenous SLV. SLV III injected Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit in July 1980 making India an exclusive Space Club member. </p>
			
			<h4>2. He also became the Project Director for two missile projects whose aim was to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme.</h4>
			<p>After the success of the SLV programme, Dr. Kalam also became the director of two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant. In the 1970s, the goal of Project Devil was to produce a short-range surface-to-air missile. Although discontinued in 1980 without achieving full success, Project Devil, led to the later development of the Prithvi missile. </p>
			
			<h4>3. He took up the responsibility of developing Indigenous Guided Missiles at DRDO </h4>
			<p>After working for two decades in ISRO, Dr. Kalam was appointed as the CEO of Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). He was responsible for the development and operationalisation of AGNI and PRITHVI missiles. <mark>This also earned him the title of 'Missile Man of India'.</mark></p>
			
			<h4>4. He was the brain behind multiple nuclear tests carried out at Pokhran in 1998 which made India a nuclear weapon state. </h4>
			<p>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was the Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister of India between 1992 and 1999 when India went ahead with the nuclear explosions at Pokhran. He supervised the Pokhran II explosions as the CEO of DRDO. While camping in the Thar desert for over a fortnight, he said: "The testing was a 'defining moment' in the country's history, next only to adopting the path of economic liberalisation in 1991."</p>
			
			<h4>5. He was deeply involved in the country's Light Combat Aircraft project. </h4>
			<p>Since passing out of the Madras Institute of Technology where he specialised in Aeronautical Engineering, President Kalam had been associated with avionics. In particular, he was deeply involved with the country's Light Combat Aircraft project. He also became the first Indian Head of State to fly a fighter plane.</p>
